Standardization Stage - NDRP Pipeline

The standardization stage is responsible for:
- Transforming extracted data into the unified NDRP schema
- Normalizing text style, tone, and formatting
- Populating required NDRP fields with appropriate defaults
- Ensuring structural consistency across all entries

This is the second stage of the three-stage NDRP pipeline:
1. Extraction - identify and isolate core meaning
2. Standardization (this stage) - transform into unified schema
3. Enhancement - improve clarity, density, and coherence
