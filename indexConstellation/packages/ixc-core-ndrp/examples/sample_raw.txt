Hello, can you help me understand neural networks?
Please explain how backpropagation works.
I feel excited about learning AI and machine learning.
Once upon a time, there was a small model that learned to predict words.
Because neural networks use gradients, they can learn complex patterns.
What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
Thank you for your help!
This conversation is really helping me understand the concepts better.
