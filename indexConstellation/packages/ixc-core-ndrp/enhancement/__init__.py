Enhancement Stage - NDRP Pipeline

The enhancement stage is responsible for:
- Improving clarity and precision of entries
- Adding explicit reasoning where needed
- Increasing information density without losing meaning
- Resolving contradictions and ambiguities
- Ensuring coherence and consistency

This is the third and final stage of the NDRP pipeline:
1. Extraction - identify and isolate core meaning
2. Standardization - transform into unified schema
3. Enhancement (this stage) - improve clarity, density, and coherence

Note: In v1, this stage is a stub that passes entries through unchanged.
Future versions will implement sophisticated enhancement logic.
